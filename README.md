# Installation

The game itself currently requires no installation provided you have Python installed on your OS. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

# Usage

You can start the game like running a standard python script with resources folder in the games current directory by typing 
"python project_eterna.py", or on some OS's you can right click the "project_eterna.py" file and choose to run with python.

There is also an .exe file within the "dist" folder thats updated periodically as new features are added. 
This is a self-contained executable file that shouldn't need any dependancies to run provided your OS supports it. 
(If on Windows, you may need to right click -> properties and unblock the .exe file for it to run properly)

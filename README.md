# Installation

The game itself currently requires no installation provided you have Python 
installed on your OS. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

# Usage

Start a console (command prompt in Windows, terminal in macOS and Linux),
navigate to the location of the game file ("RPG-Lite.py") and run it by
typing "./RPG-Lite.py" (type "python RPG-Lite.py" on Windows). This will 
start the game and allow you to create a character. Once in the game you 
can start your adventure! On some systems, you may also right click the 
game file ("RPG-Lite.py") and choose to "Open with --> Python".

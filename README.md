# Installation

The game itself currently requires no installation provided you have Python installed on your OS (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
You can run the requirements.txt file to install PyGame with the command "pip install -r requirements.txt".

# Usage

Once the project is downloaded, navigate to the folder with your command line and type "python project_eterna.py", 
or with some OS's you can just right click the "project_eterna.py" file and choose to run with python.

There is also an .exe file within the "dist" folder thats updated periodically as new features are added. 
This is a self-contained executable file that shouldn't need any dependancies to run provided your OS supports it. 
(If on Windows, you may need to right click -> properties and unblock the .exe file for it to run properly)
